# Privacy Policy
This policy outlines how we handle information in TaskWire. **We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information from you.**

## Information We Don't Collect
TaskWire does not collect any personal data. We don't ask for, process, or store your name, email, location, or any other identifying information.

## How We Use Information (We Don't)
Since we don't collect user data, there's nothing for us to use, process, analyze, or share. Your tasks and preferences are solely yours.

## Where Your Data Resides
All your TaskWire data—tasks, settings, and preferences—is stored **locally on your device**. We cannot access this information, nor is it stored on our servers or in the cloud.

## No Third-Party Involvement
TaskWire operates independently. We don't integrate with any third-party services that would collect or process your data. Your information stays with you, on your device.

## Network Printing Privacy Considerations
When you print tasks to network printers, please be aware of the following privacy considerations:

**Network Transmission**: Task content is transmitted over your local network to reach the printer. While this transmission is typically secure within your local network, be aware that:
- Task content may be visible to other devices on the same network
- Network administrators may have access to print job logs
- Print jobs may be cached or stored temporarily on the printer or print server

**Printer Storage**: Network printers may store print job data in their memory or storage:
- Print job content may remain in printer memory until overwritten
- Some printers maintain print history or job logs
- Printer administrators may access stored print data

**Recommendations**: To protect your privacy when printing tasks:
- Use network printers on trusted, secure networks
- Be mindful of task content when printing to shared or public printers
- Review your printer's security and privacy settings

## Data Security: Your Responsibility
While we don't collect your data, securing your local information is crucial. We encourage you to use appropriate device security measures (like strong passwords and encryption) to protect your TaskWire data and all other information on your device.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this policy if our practices change. Please review it periodically.

## Your Rights
Since we don't collect personal data, standard data privacy rights (like accessing, modifying, or deleting personal information) don't apply. All your data remains under your control, stored only on your local device.
